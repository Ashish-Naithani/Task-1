#🧹 Data Cleaning Project – Internship Task
This repository contains the completed task from the first phase of our internship, where we focused on cleaning and preparing a raw dataset for analysis.

📌 Objective
The primary objective of this task was to transform a raw, unstructured dataset into a clean, consistent, and analysis-ready format by applying essential data cleaning techniques. 
This step is critical in the data analysis pipeline, as clean data forms the foundation for accurate insights.

✅ Task Highlights
Key steps performed during the cleaning process:

🕳️ Handling Missing Values
Identified and managed null or empty entries using appropriate imputation or removal strategies.

♻️ Removing Duplicates
Detected and dropped duplicated records to maintain data integrity.

📅 Achieving Consistent Formats
Standardized inconsistent data formats, especially in columns like dates, numerical values, and categories.

🧹 General Cleaning
Trimmed whitespaces, corrected typos, normalized text cases, and ensured overall consistency.

🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used
Python (pandas) for data manipulation

Excel / Power Query

Basic EDA to identify data quality issues

🚀 Outcome
The cleaned dataset is now ready for further steps such as visualization, modeling, or reporting. This task helped reinforce best practices in data preprocessing, a vital part of every data science or business intelligence workflow.
